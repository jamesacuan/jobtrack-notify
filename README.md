# netops-fix

![screenshot](sample.PNG)

Just a missing piece for our netops sites that it could work well with modern day browsers. This extension will basically show a toast notification and dynamically replaces the favicon for every new jobtrack or an unassigned overdue jobtrack. This would also reload the page when the site crashes.

## TO-DO
- allows direct copy to clipboard when double clicking
- login/logout on all sites from extension
- design fixes

This works with Chrome and Firefox.
