# jobtrack-notify

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesacuan/jobtrack-notify/master/sample.png)

Just a missing piece for our jobtrack website. It shows a toast notification for every new jobtrack or an unassigned overdue jobtrack. This would also automatically reload the page when site crashes.

This works with Chrome and Firefox.
