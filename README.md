# netops-fix

![screenshot](sample.PNG)

Just a missing piece for our netops sites that it could work well with modern day browsers. This extension will basically extend a few features that would help optimize our work.

## Features
- show a toast notification for every new jobtrack or an unassigned overdue jobtrack.
- replaces favicon when there's new notification
- auto reload site when site crashes (yup, our site randomly crashes, well, fret not)
- An easy access to turnover through browser action
- direct copy to clipboard on email accounts information

## TO-DO
- login/logout on all sites from extension.
- design fixes

This works with Chrome and Firefox.
