# netops-fix

Just a missing piece for our netops sites that it could work well with modern day browsers. This extension will basically extend a few features that would help optimize our work.

## Features

![screenshot](sample.PNG)
- shows notification for every new jobtrack or an unassigned overdue jobtrack
- auto reload site when site crashes (yup, our site randomly crashes, well, fret not)
- An easy access to turnover through browser action
- added direct copy to clipboard on relevant information
- design fixes

## TO-DO
- login/logout on all sites from extension.
- menu through browser action
- lightbox on select images.

This works with Chrome and Firefox.
