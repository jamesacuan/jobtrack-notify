# jobtrack-notify

![screenshot](sample.PNG)

Just a missing piece for our jobtrack website so it could work well with modern day browsers. This extension will show a toast notification and dynamically replaces the favicon for every new jobtrack or an unassigned overdue jobtrack. This would also reload the page when the site crashes.

This works with Chrome and Firefox.
